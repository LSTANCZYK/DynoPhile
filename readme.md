# DynoPhile - A dynamic, ExpandoObject-o-matic, file-to-poco parser, yeah.

The idea is simple. Take a CSV file, sprinkle some dynamic and ExpandoObject magic, and get a list of plain old object back.

Warning - this is a toy and experimental code. Perhaps it will turn into something, perhaps it will not. Who knows.
